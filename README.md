# Functional Analysis of Literary Themes

## Project Overview

This C++ project, developed for the Functional Programming course (FPROG), utilizes functional programming concepts to analyze literary texts. The program reads a large text file (e.g., "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy) and categorizes its chapters as either war-related or peace-related based on the density of specific terms. This is achieved using two additional text files: one containing war-related terms and another with peace-related terms.
